🏠 Boston House Price Prediction

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts the prices of houses in Boston based on different features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways.

🚀 Project Overview
This project uses the **Boston Housing dataset** to train a regression model that predicts house prices.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation using Python.

🧠 Features
- Load and explore the Boston Housing dataset  
- Visualize relationships between features and target price  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Train a regression model using **Linear Regression**  
- Evaluate model performance with metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error  


🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- ** Google Colab **
- **pandas**, **numpy**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**


📊 Steps Involved
1. Import and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing or inconsistent data  
3. Visualize correlations between variables  
4. Train a regression model (Linear Regression)  
5. Test and evaluate the prediction accuracy  


📈 Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:
- R² Score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

These metrics help to understand how well the model predicts house prices compared to actual data.
